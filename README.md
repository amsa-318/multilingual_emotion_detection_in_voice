# Multilingual Emotion Detection in Voice

## Overview

This notebook presents a project for **detecting emotions from voice recordings** across multiple languages. It leverages audio processing techniques and machine learning to classify emotional states such as happy, sad, angry, etc., from speech data.

## Objectives

* To preprocess and extract meaningful features from multilingual audio recordings.
* To train a machine learning or deep learning model to classify emotions based on these features.
* To evaluate the performance and generalization of the model on diverse languages.

## Key Components

### 1. **Imports & Dependencies**

Includes:

* `librosa` for audio processing
* `numpy`, `pandas` for data handling
* `sklearn` for ML models and evaluation
* `matplotlib` for visualizations
* TensorFlow/Keras (optional, if deep learning models are used)

### 2. **Data Loading**

The notebook likely supports datasets such as:

* RAVDESS
* TESS
* SAVEE
* Or other multilingual datasets

### 3. **Audio Feature Extraction**

Extracted features may include:

* MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)
* Chroma features
* Mel spectrograms
* Zero Crossing Rate, etc.

### 4. **Preprocessing**

* Normalizing data
* Handling different sampling rates and file formats
* Augmentation (optional)

### 5. **Model Building**

Models used may include:

* Random Forest / SVM / KNN (classical ML)
* CNNs or RNNs (for deep learning approaches)

### 6. **Training & Evaluation**

* Train/test split or cross-validation
* Evaluation metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1-score

### 7. **Multilingual Consideration**

* Ensures that the model is exposed to samples from various languages.
* Possibly balances classes across languages to ensure fairness.

### 8. **Visualization**

* Plotting confusion matrices, training curves, or feature distributions.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `librosa`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow/keras` (if DL is used)

## Usage

```bash
jupyter notebook multilingual_emotion_detection_in_voice.ipynb
